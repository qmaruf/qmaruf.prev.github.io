Just installed `tmux` to see how this tool works. I have been using `terminator` for a long time, but OSX doens't have a good support for `terminator` i think. `tmux` seems like a good alternative but I am missing the mouse interaction of `terminator` here. I'm using only two commands right now.

```
[ctrl-b + %]  split the current pane into left and right
[ctrl-b + "] split the current pane into top and bottom
[ctrl-b + arrow keys] switch between panes
```

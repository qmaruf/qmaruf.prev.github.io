|     Correspondingly     |                       As a result                       |          However          |      While (not whilst!)     |                          To clarify                         | It can be concluded that |
|         Equally         |                           Thus                          |         Conversely        |            Even so           |                 Further (not ‘furthermore’)                 |      As can be seen      |

|        Similarly        |                         Because                         |            Yet            |          Nonetheless         |                           Moreover                          |       As described       |
|                         |                        Therefore                        |      On the contrary      |           Although           |                          Typically                          |          Finally         |

|                         |                     It follows that                     |                           |                              |                            Namely                           |                          |
